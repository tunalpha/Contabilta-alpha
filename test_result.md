# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The balance calculation API correctly calculates the balance as total_avere - total_dare. The advanced search and filtering functionality is working as expected. Network requests show that the API is being called with the appropriate parameters. All backend features are working correctly."

    message: "Completed testing of the PDF generation functionality. The endpoint /api/clients/{client_slug}/pdf successfully generates PDFs with proper date filtering. Tested with both date_from and date_to parameters, with only date_from, with only date_to, and without any date parameters. All tests passed. The PDF includes proper period information in the header, the filename includes date range when applicable, and the PDF structure is professional and readable. Data integrity is maintained with correct balance calculations for filtered periods."

    message: "Fixed critical multi-currency display issue. USD transactions were being saved correctly in database with currency, original_amount, and exchange_rate fields, but the TransactionResponse model was missing these fields so they weren't being returned in API responses. This caused the frontend to always show EUR converted amounts instead of original USD amounts."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Fixed the multi-currency functionality by updating the TransactionResponse model to include currency, original_amount, and exchange_rate fields. Verified that API now correctly returns currency fields and that currency conversion calculation is working properly (40.0 USD * 0.852 = 34.08 EUR). Multi-currency display should now work correctly in frontend."

    message: "Successfully tested the GET /api/transactions endpoint for the Sovanza client to verify currency fields. All USD transactions correctly return currency='USD', original_amount (the original USD amount), and exchange_rate fields. Verified two existing USD transactions: one for $40 USD (Payment Link) and another for $198 USD (Science alert). Both show correct currency conversion with exchange_rate=0.852. Also created and verified a test $50 USD transaction which correctly converted to 42.60 EUR. All currency fields are being returned properly in the API response."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Completed testing of the multi-currency display functionality for USD transactions. Verified that the formatCurrencyWithOriginal function is correctly displaying USD amounts with $ symbol in the transaction list. Console logs confirm that the function receives the correct data (currency='USD', originalAmount=40 or 198) and formats it as '$40.00' and '$198.00'. The UI correctly shows the transactions with their original USD amounts ('-$40.00' and '+$198.00') while maintaining EUR for balance calculations (134.62 ‚Ç¨ Saldo Netto). The issue reported by the user has been fixed - USD transactions are now properly displayed with their original USD amounts rather than showing as EUR amounts."

Tested Transaction CRUD API with filtering (client_slug, type, category, date range, search), Balance calculation API (dare/avere), Multi-currency functionality for USD transactions, Admin authentication, and Clients API. Verified that Sovanza client has USD transactions with proper currency conversion (exchange_rate=0.852). All tests passed successfully, confirming that the backend is working perfectly after the frontend fix."
