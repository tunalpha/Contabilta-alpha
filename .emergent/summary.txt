The AI engineer's trajectory focused on enhancing Contabilità Alpha, a financial application, from an MVP to a robust system. Key areas of work included implementing multi-currency support, adding a date picker for transactions, and resolving persistent display issues, notably with the logo. Debugging proved iterative, especially for the multi-currency feature, which required multiple rounds of frontend and backend inspection to ensure original amounts and currencies were correctly displayed. A significant challenge arose with the logo, where attempts to update it led to syntax errors and service outages, causing user frustration. Concurrently, critical bugs related to date input for transactions emerged. The AI engineer's approach involved direct code edits,  debugging, and reliance on testing agents, often responding reactively to user-reported breakages rather than proactively preventing them. The project is currently in a state where a syntax error is preventing the application from loading, amidst unresolved date and logo display issues.

<product_requirements>
The Contabilità Alpha application is a professional multi-client accounting system. Its core purpose is to track income (Avere) and expenses (Dare) with detailed transaction management including amount, description, type, date, and categories. It provides a real-time net balance and a chronological transaction list with advanced filtering by description, payment method, type, and custom date ranges. The application supports full CRUD operations on transactions.

Key features and enhancements implemented or required:
- **User Interface**: Intuitive Italian UI with Tailwind CSS, visual cues, and a custom logo.
- **Authorization**: Admin login for full CRUD, read-only for shared client links.
- **Multi-Client System**: Supports up to 30 clients with isolated data, dedicated URLs (e.g., ), and a central admin dashboard.
- **Password Recovery**: Email-based recovery.
- **PDF Reports**: Professional PDF generation for client transactions with date filters.
- **Multilingual Support**: Toggle between Italian and English for all UI texts.
- **Client Link Reset**: Admin ability to generate new secure client slugs.
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Ability to add transactions in USD/GBP, automatic conversion to EUR for main balance, but retaining and displaying original currency for individual transactions.
- **Date Selection**: Mandatory ability to select a specific date for transactions, enabling retroactive entries.
- **Dynamic Weekly Transactions**: Specific for Bill client.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:


-   ****:
    *   **Summary**: The core FastAPI backend handling API endpoints, MongoDB interactions, and business logic.
    *   **Changes Made**:
        *   Enhanced  Pydantic model and  endpoint to include , , and  for multi-currency support, performing USD/GBP to EUR conversion.
        *   Added  function and  endpoint for real-time currency rates using .
        *   Updated  endpoint to also perform currency conversion.
        *   Modified  to return , , and  for frontend display.
        *   Crucially,  model was updated to correctly expose these new currency fields after initial debugging.

-   ****:
    *   **Summary**: The main React component managing UI, state, and backend communication. This file contains most of the application's logic and UI components.
    *   **Changes Made**:
        *   Integrated  for multilingual support (Italian/English).
        *   Implemented multi-currency UI:  for  and , added a currency selector (dropdown) to both New Transaction and Edit Transaction forms.
        *   Updated  and  states to include  and Tue Jul  8 12:52:50 UTC 2025.
        *   Modified  and  to send currency and date data to the backend.
        *   Implemented  function to display original currency (e.g., 00) in transaction lists, along with a tooltip showing the EUR equivalent.
        *   Added a date input field to the New Transaction form.
        *   Attempts were made to replace the logo display with a CSS-based design, leading to syntax errors which were later partially fixed by removing problematic SVG code.
        *   Attempts to fix  for date saving led to a new syntax error.

-   ****:
    *   **Summary**: Python dependencies for FastAPI.
    *   **Changes Made**: Added  for PDF generation and  for external currency API calls.

-   ****:
    *   **Summary**: Node.js dependencies for React.
    *   **Changes Made**: Added  and  for multilingual support.

-   ****:
    *   **Summary**: Log of testing results and protocol.
    *   **Changes Made**: Frequently updated with backend and frontend test summaries for various features.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was grappling with multiple critical issues, leading to the application being completely inaccessible.

1.  **Multi-currency display**: Although the AI engineer claimed to have resolved the issue (Chat 94) where USD transactions were showing in EUR, the user continued to report the problem (Chat 95). The AI then attempted fixes related to  vs  naming consistency and general optimization (Chat 98-102). The user later confirmed multi-currency display was working correctly (Chat 115).

2.  **Date selection bugs**:
    *   **New Transactions**: The user reported that the newly added date field for new transactions was visible but the selected date was not being saved (Chat 189). The AI identified that the  function in  was hardcoding  instead of using  (Chat 198). An attempt to fix this (Chat 199, 207) resulted in a syntax error.
    *   **Edit Transactions**: The user also pointed out that the date field was entirely missing from the Edit Transaction form (Chat 189). This task remains unaddressed.

3.  **Logo visibility**: After multiple attempts to implement a new CSS-based logo, and resolving a major syntax error that brought down the entire application (Chat 170-177), the user confirmed the new logo was visible on the admin dashboard but *not* on client-specific pages (Chat 181). The AI engineer attempted to rectify this (Chat 192-193) but subsequent actions led to further syntax errors.

The last communication from the user (Chat 208) states, Non funziona nulla non si apre nemmeno (Nothing works, it doesn't even open), indicating that the application is currently broken, likely due to the syntax error introduced while fixing the date saving in  (Chat 199, 207). The AI engineer's last thought (Chat 209) acknowledges a syntax error and plans to repair it. The user is highly frustrated due to persistent issues and spent budget.
