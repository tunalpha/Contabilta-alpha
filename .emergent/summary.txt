The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles the iterative development and refinement of Contabilità Alpha, a financial tracking application. Initially focused on building core income/expense tracking, the work quickly expanded to address complex user demands, including multi-client support, advanced filtering, and robust authentication. A recurring theme involved persistent debugging, particularly around transaction edit/delete functionalities and logo integration, which presented significant challenges and required multiple strategic pivots (e.g., from SVG recreation to base64 for the logo). The engineer demonstrated adaptability by incorporating new features like email-based password recovery, multi-language support (Italian/English), and professional PDF report generation with data filtering. Most recently, the focus shifted to implementing multi-currency support (USD to EUR), which exposed complexities in data persistence and display logic, leading to an ongoing debugging effort to ensure both correct conversion and accurate visual representation of original currencies.

*   **Password Recovery**: Email-based recovery to  via Gmail SMTP.
*   **Multi-Client System**: Scalable architecture for up to 30 clients, isolated data, dedicated URLs (e.g., ), and central admin dashboard. Clients have read-only access.
*   **Dynamic Weekly Transactions**: For Bill client, manual Incasso carte settimanale additions from July 7, 2025.
*   **PDF Reports**: Generate professional PDF reports for client transactions, including full history or filtered by date range, available to both client and admin.
*   **Multilingual Support**: Toggle between Italian and English for all UI texts, including transaction descriptions.
*   **Client Link Reset**: Admin ability to reset a client's public link, invalidating the old one and generating a new, secure one.
*   **Multi-Currency Support**: Ability to add transactions in USD (and implicitly GBP) with automatic conversion to EUR for the main balance display, while retaining and showing the original currency for individual transactions.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in resolving a critical issue with the **multi-currency display** for transactions. The user reported that while the system correctly performed the currency conversion (e.g., from USD to EUR), the transaction list *always displayed the amount in EUR* (e.g., €85.20) rather than the original currency symbol and amount (e.g., 00.00). The user's explicit requirement was to see the original currency in the transaction list, with the main balance showing the converted EUR value.

The AI engineer's debugging efforts revealed several points of failure:
1.  **Backend Data Inconsistency**: Initial checks showed that existing transactions in the database did not have , , and  fields, leading to  values when retrieved by . This was expected for *old* data.
2.  **Frontend Debugging**: The AI added  statements within  (specifically in ) to inspect the data being received by the frontend. These logs confirmed that even for *newly created USD transactions*, the  field was , and  was often , despite the  request to the backend seemingly being successful (200 OK). This implied either the frontend was not sending the original currency data correctly, or the backend was not persisting it correctly for new transactions.
3.  **Backend PUT Endpoint Fix**: A crucial discovery was that the  endpoint (used for modifying transactions) was not performing currency conversion. This was fixed, but the display issue for *new* transactions persisted.
4.  **Display Logic Refinement**: The  function in  was updated to prioritize showing the  and  symbol, along with a tooltip to display the converted EUR value.
5.  **Current Status**: Despite these fixes, the user continued to report that new USD transactions still appeared as converted EUR in the transaction list. The last diagnostic attempt involved checking backend logs for transaction POST requests, which showed , leading the AI engineer to suspect the issue lies in how the data is *saved* or *retrieved* from the database, even if the API call is successful. The engineer confirmed the problem is resolvable.

The immediate state is that  is confirmed installed and the backend currency exchange rate endpoint is working correctly. The next step is to directly inspect the database for new USD transactions.

<optional_next_step>
I will directly check the MongoDB database for a newly created USD transaction to verify if , , and  fields are correctly saved.
